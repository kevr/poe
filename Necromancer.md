Get as soon as possible for upcoming skills:
- B-B-B
- B-B-B
- B-B-R

First Skill:
- Magma Orb

Next, get Quicksilver Flask from Tidal Island quest.

From Quest Rewards:
- Flame Wall
- Frostblink
- Summon Phantasm Support

Buy:
- Infused Channeling Support
- Arcane Surge

At Prison waypoint, go back to town and get SRS (Summon Raging Spirits), Minion Damage and Infernal Legion. These should be linked together in a `B-B-B`.

Keep a look out for Iron rings.

After Brutus, pick up `Vitality` and `Smokemine`. You can also pick up `Clarity` or `Precision`.

We will need a `Jade` amulet to boost dexterity if we do not have it.

Get `Sapphire` rings for the Merveil fight.

With 3 - 4 link helmet, attempt to craft together a `Reanimator's` helmet with the following vendor recipe:

```
Let B = Bone Spirit Shield
Let T = Transmutation Orb
Let F = Life Flask (Any)

Let FA = B + T + F = F [of Animation]

Let A = Alteration Orb
Let H = Helmet (Any)

Let RH = FA + A + H = [Reanimator's] H
```

`Reanimator's` gives the `+1 to Level of Socketed Minion Gems` mod to the helmet with no other mods. A resistance craft can then be added.

Down the road, we'll want to buy:
- Desecrate
  - Flesh Offering
  - Bone Offering

And, if you want to go the physical route, modify your minion gems:
- Raise Zombie
  - Minion Damage
  - Minion Speed
- Raise Skeleton
  - Minion Damage
  - Minion Speed
- Spectres

**TIP**
Look for a shield and a sword which we can apply essences of `Fear` to. Apparently this buffs our minions.

Summon `Carnage Chieftans` spectres from Act 2.

Use the `Carrion Golem` gem later.
